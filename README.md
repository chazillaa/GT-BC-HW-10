  ## Description:
  This application creates an easy way to create a team for any new projects that may be in development. Using tools such as HTML, Node.js, Inquirer, as well as Jest we can build a simple HTML page that displays each member of the team along with details about the individual such as email or github profile. Using classes, and constructors, prompts will appear in the terminal once Node is ran, and the user can simply answer each question to create their own team profile.
  &nbsp;  
  ## Installation:
  To run this application the user must run "npm init" command to to set up a package.json file and the "npm i inquirer" to install the Inquirer package into the package.json file, as well as "npm i jest" for the tests. Once that has been done the user can run the application in the terminal by using the command "node index.js"

  ## Usage:
  Once "node index.js" is ran, the application can be used to create a team profile HTML page that will display a description of each member of a team for a given project. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pwzEaQxjoJPT95woaqeYfxtKigNBveoy/view
